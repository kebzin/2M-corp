      "In partnership with district health authorities and local clinical teams, 2M Corp implemented an integrated data platform that aggregates patient records, laboratory results, and service delivery metrics across 50+ facilities. The project focused on pragmatic data pipelines, secure data governance, and dashboards that frontline managers could use to make timely decisions.",
      "The platform reduced reporting latency from weeks to hours, enabling faster stock reallocation for essential medicines and more responsive supervision for critical care units. By automating routine ETL tasks and standardising data models, the solution lowered administrative burden and improved data quality for monitoring and evaluation.",
      "Capacity building was a central pillar: we trained health information officers and clinical staff on data interpretation, dashboard use, and basic analytics workflows. The combined approach — technology plus local skills — resulted in measurable improvements in service coverage metrics and faster identification of outbreak signals.",
